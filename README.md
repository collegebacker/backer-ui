# Backer UI

Backer UI is using [RollupJS](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) to build the bundle and [React Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to preview the components.

We also use [Chromatic] to test the components and preview them in the browser with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

### Run locally

1. copy repo to your local machine
2. run `yarn`
3. run `yarn storybook` to view the UI or `yarn rollup` to build the bundle.
