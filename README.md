# Backer UI

Backer UI is using [RollupJS](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) to build the bundle and [React Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to preview the components.

We also use [Chromatic] to test the components and preview them in the browser with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

### Backer UI Storybook

Storybook â€” https://main--629496e95fff28004a61a2a4.chromatic.com

Chromatic app â€” https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=629496e95fff28004a61a2a4

Ask for permission to use the storybook UI to preview the components. If you're memmber of the Backer team you should have permission automatically.
