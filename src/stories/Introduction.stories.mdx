# Welcome to Backer UI 0.1.0

Here you can find all the documentation for the components and the API. Backer UI is a React UI library that is built on top of [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start).

All components in the library are core to the project and are used by the other components and application.

# How to use

## Installation

Add the line below to your `package.json` `dependencies` file. You can use the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) package manager. Do not forget to add the actual version of the library as a tag. View all tags [here](https://github.com/collegebacker/backer-ui/tags).

```json
"@collegebacker/backer-ui": "git://github.com/collegebacker/backer-ui.git#tag-version"
```

## Usage

After installing the library, you can use it by importing it in your application.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@collegebacker/backer-ui/ui";
```

# Components

Backer UI has 3 types of components:

- **`Core`**: These are the core components that are used by the other components and application. <br/> They are outside the context.
- **`App`**: These are the components that are used by the application only.
- **`Marketing`**: These are the components that are used by the marketing components.

For now we merged the `core` components and the `marketing` components into one `ui` library. This will be changed in the future if there will be more stable components.

Let's store contextual components for the `app` and `marketing` components in they own repositories for now. It will speed up the development process until we need more control over the components.

# Tokens

For any UI, no matter the context, there are tokens that are used to style the components.

- **`colors.css`** - This file contains all the colors used in the UI in native css format.
- **`_grids.scss`**
- **`_spacers.scss`**
- **`_typography-common.scss`**
- **`_typography-app.csss`**
- **`_typography-marketing.scss`**
- **`_radii.scss`**

## Import

You can get them separately `@collegebacker/backer-ui/tokens/**`

```jsx
// TSX
import "@collegebacker/backer-ui/styles/colors.css";
```

```css
/* CSS */
@import "@collegebacker/backer-ui/styles/colors.css";
```

# Styles

In order to convey the best experience for the user and make the development process easier, we use the following styles:

- **`all.scss`** - This file contains all the styles that are used in the UI.<br/>
  If you want to skip manually importing the styles, you can use this file.
- **`reset.css`** - Reset styles
- **`fonts.css`** - Load fonts
- **`global.css`** - Global styles that fixed initial styles
- **`typography-app.scss`** - App styles
- **`typography-marketing.scss`** - Marketing styles

## Import

You can get them separately `@collegebacker/backer-ui/styles/**`

```jsx
// TSX
import "@collegebacker/backer-ui/styles/all.scss";
```

```css
/* CSS */
@import "@collegebacker/backer-ui/styles/colors.scss";
