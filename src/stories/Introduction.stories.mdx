# Welcome to Backer UI 0.1.0

Here you can find all the documentation for the components and the API. Backer UI is a React UI library that is built on top of [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start).

All components in the library are core to the project and are used by the other components and application.

# Components

Backer UI has 3 types of components:

- **`Core`**: These are the core components that are used by the other components and application. <br/> They are outside the context.
- **`App`**: These are the components that are used by the application only.
- **`Marketing`**: These are the components that are used by the marketing components.

For now we merged the `core` components and the `marketing` components into one `ui` library. This will be changed in the future if there will be more stable components.

Let's store contextual components for the `app` and `marketing` components in they own repositories for now. It will speed up the development process until we need more control over the components.

# Tokens

For any UI, no matter the context, there are tokens that are used to style the components.
