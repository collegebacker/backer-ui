          Backer is the easiest way to save for college with help from family
          and friends. We&apos;ll help you invest your savings with a tax-free
          529 Savings Plan, which is like a retirement account for your
          child&apos;s education. It&apos;s a government-sponsored account and
          is the smartest way to avoid future student debt.

        <Text tag="p" context="marketing" marketingStyle="paragraph">
          With Backer, it&apos;s simple to involve family and friends in the
          process. These ‚Äúbackers‚Äù can quickly and easily contribute to your
          child&apos;s education fund and stay involved as your child gets
          closer to college. Our most active customers save 4x more by building
          a team of backers for their kids.

        Studies have shown that simply having a college fund can dramatically
        improve educational outcomes. Backer amplifies this effect by having
        your family and friends chip in, and then investing all of the savings
        tax-free. We&apos;ve also noticed parents on our platform contribute
        more&nbsp;
        <em>themselves</em> when they have a team of friends and relatives along
        for the ride. Just like it&apos;s helpful to have a gym buddy or study
        buddy, having a team of backers for your kids is super motivating and
        helps you make much faster progress toward your savings goals.

            The age-old saying goes: it takes a village. But today‚Äôs parents are
            more likely than ever to be raising their kid in isolation. We no
            longer have grandparents living just down the road, and new parents
            instead juggle full-time baby-raising alongside dual incomes, and
            little material or face-to-face support.
