          Backer is the easiest way to save for college with help from family
          and friends. We&apos;ll help you invest your savings with a tax-free
          529 Savings Plan, which is like a retirement account for your
          child&apos;s education. It&apos;s a government-sponsored account and
          is the smartest way to avoid future student debt.
        </p>
        <p className="typo-marketing-paragraph">
          With Backer, it&apos;s simple to involve family and friends in the
          process. These ‚Äúbackers‚Äù can quickly and easily contribute to your
          child&apos;s education fund and stay involved as your child gets
          closer to college. Our most active customers save 4x more by building
          a team of backers for their kids.

        Studies have shown that simply having a college fund can dramatically
        improve educational outcomes. Backer amplifies this effect by having
        your family and friends chip in, and then investing all of the savings
        tax-free. We&apos;ve also noticed parents on our platform contribute
        more&nbsp;
        <em>themselves</em> when they have a team of friends and relatives along
        for the ride. Just like it&apos;s helpful to have a gym buddy or study
        buddy, having a team of backers for your kids is super motivating and
        helps you make much faster progress toward your savings goals.
